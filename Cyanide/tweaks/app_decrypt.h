//  Settings → Lara → App Decrypt: makes a decrypted IPA of an App Store app
//  installed on this device, e.g. to inject a tweak into it and sideload it.
//  Idea from lara by rooootdev; implemented on Cyanide's own KRW. iOS 18
//  refuses mremap_encrypted outside the app itself, so the app is started
//  suspended in the background and its decrypted pages are read through the
//  kernel from the FairPlay pager objects in its VM map. Encrypted app
//  extensions aren't loaded by the app and are left out.
//
//  Needs filesystem access (sandbox lifted). Blocking; run off-main.
