//  font_patcher.h
//  Cyanide
//
//  Makes an ordinary TrueType font usable as an iOS system font, on the
//  device: the same idea as lara's font patcher (rooootdev / neonmodder123,
//  which uses fontTools in the browser). iOS asks for the system font by its
//  weight axes and their names, which a plain font doesn't have, so it falls
//  back to another font. The result keeps the system font's identity (fvar,
//  avar, STAT, trak, meta and the names they use) with the new font's glyphs,
//  an empty gvar so every weight shows them, and is scaled to the system
//  font's units per em.
//
//  Differences from lara's patcher: hinting is dropped (iOS doesn't use it),
//  kerning (GPOS) is dropped when the font has to be scaled, and system-font
//  tables that refer to its own glyph numbers (morx, kerx, ...) are dropped
//  instead of kept, since they would point at the wrong glyphs.
//
